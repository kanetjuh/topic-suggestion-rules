# topic-suggestion-rules

The rules for approval and disapproval of topic suggestions.

# When approving and disapproving, remember:

1. NO RACIAL SLURS/DEROGATORY TERMS (do not allow "iggern iggern iggern" requests or anything to close to derogatory terms)
2. NO DOXXING (watch out for phone numbers, addresses and coordinates etc.)
3. NO THREATS (bomb threats, murder threats etc.)
4. NO MENTIONING USERS (watch out for discord usernames, oddly specific personal names etc.)
5. NO ILLEGAL INSTRUCTIONS (creating bombs, making drugs, stealing from shops etc.)
6. NO HITLER MENTIONS (NO MATTER WHAT)

# Remember

Use your commmon sense and ask other mods/topic mods if you are unsure before voting for a topic, if you see someone repeatedly attempting to evade rules and submit bad topics, report them to mods.
